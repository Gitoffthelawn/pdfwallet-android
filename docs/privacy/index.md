## Data Processing
PDF Wallet operates **entirely on your device**.
All documents and related information remain local and are **never sent** to us or to any third party.
We have **no access** to your files, passwords, or usage data.

PDFs you open are stored only in the app’s private storage area and can be deleted at any time — either within the app or by uninstalling it.
Passwords used to unlock encrypted PDFs are handled only in memory and are not saved or transmitted.

Because all processing happens locally on your device, **no personal data is collected or processed** by the developer under the meaning of the EU GDPR.

## In-App Purchases
Our app may offer optional in-app purchases.
All transactions are processed securely through **Google Play Billing**.
We do not have access to, nor do we collect or store, any personal payment information such as your name, credit card number, or billing address.
Google provides us only with anonymized transaction identifiers and status information (e.g., confirmation of purchase or refund) to deliver the purchased content.

For more information about how Google processes your payment data, please refer to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Ads & Tracking
The app contains **no ads** and performs **no tracking or analytics**.
  
### Open Source
The [source code of the app](https://github.com/michaeltroger/pdfwallet-android) is completely open source, allowing you to verify how it works.
